Replace Android OS with Chrome OS on the Nexus 5x.
I have always been a huge Google Services user but I'm not very fond of the Android OS. Using Java IMO is a poor choice for mobile platforms because mobile requires performance. Chrome has caught my eye as a fantastic alternative. Just look at what its done to laptops! Chromebooks speak for themselves with an average 10-hour battery life while having a battery that is just a tad larger than that on your phone, incredible speed and security and reliable as hell too. I don't see why Google isn't working on this. But hey if they aren't then I will!
